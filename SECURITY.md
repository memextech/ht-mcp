## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in HT-MCP, please follow these steps:

### üö® Do NOT create a public issue

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### üìß Report Privately

Instead, please email us at: **security@memex.tech**

Include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve by exploiting this vulnerability
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions of HT-MCP are affected
- **Environment**: Operating system, Rust version, and any other relevant details
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, provide a minimal proof of concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the vulnerability

### üîí Encryption (Optional)

For highly sensitive reports, you may encrypt your email using our PGP key:

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP key would be provided here in a real implementation]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

## Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week, we will assess the vulnerability and its impact
- **Resolution**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed within 2 weeks
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline

## Disclosure Process

1. **Private Disclosure**: You report the vulnerability privately to security@memex.tech
2. **Assessment**: We assess and verify the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Release**: We release a patched version
5. **Public Disclosure**: We publicly disclose the vulnerability (with your permission)
6. **Recognition**: We acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Measures

HT-MCP implements several security measures:

### Code Security
- **Memory Safety**: Written in Rust for memory safety guarantees
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of dependencies using `cargo audit`
- **Static Analysis**: Code analysis using Clippy and other tools
- **Fuzzing**: Planned implementation of fuzz testing for input validation

### Build Security
- **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic builds when possible
- **Signed Releases**: GitHub releases are signed and verified
- **Supply Chain Security**: Dependencies are verified and regularly updated

### Runtime Security
- **Sandboxing**: Terminal sessions are isolated from the host system
- **Input Validation**: All MCP inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Resource Limits**: Protection against resource exhaustion attacks
- **Secure Defaults**: Secure configuration defaults

## Threat Model

HT-MCP's threat model considers the following attack vectors:

### In Scope
- **Malicious MCP Commands**: Commands designed to exploit the terminal interface
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Attacks that consume excessive system resources
- **Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized access to system information
- **Code Injection**: Attempts to execute arbitrary code through terminal interfaces
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Security issues in third-party dependencies

### Out of Scope
- **Host System Vulnerabilities**: Issues with the underlying operating system
- **Network Security**: TLS/network security is handled by the MCP transport layer
- **Physical Access**: Attacks requiring physical access to the system
- **Social Engineering**: Attacks targeting users rather than the software

## Best Practices for Users

To use HT-MCP securely:

### Installation
- **Verify Downloads**: Always verify checksums when downloading binaries
- **Use Package Managers**: Preferred installation via `cargo install` or official packages
- **Keep Updated**: Regularly update to the latest version

### Configuration
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run HT-MCP with minimal necessary permissions
- **Resource Limits**: Configure appropriate resource limits for terminal sessions
- **Monitoring**: Monitor HT-MCP logs for suspicious activity

### Integration
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs from MCP clients
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for MCP connections
- **Network Security**: Use secure transport for MCP communications

## Security Resources

- **Security Advisories**: Published on GitHub Security Advisories
- **CVE Database**: Vulnerabilities are reported to the CVE database when applicable
