Test complex commit using git commit -F approach

This demonstrates that using git commit -F file.txt works correctly 
while git commit -m with complex messages fails due to:

1. Key sequence duplication in ht_send_keys
2. Special character escaping issues  
3. Shell parsing problems with markdown URLs
4. UTF-8 emoji encoding issues when sent as individual keys
