# HT-MCP-Rust

A pure Rust implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides headless terminal functionality.

## Overview

HT-MCP-Rust replaces the existing Node.js/TypeScript implementation with a more efficient, self-contained Rust solution that directly integrates the `ht` (headless terminal) library instead of using subprocess communication.

## Features

- **Pure Rust Implementation**: No external dependencies, single binary deployment
- **Direct HT Integration**: Library-level integration for better performance
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Full compatibility with MCP clients
- **Session Management**: Multiple concurrent terminal sessions
- **Web Server Support**: Optional web interface for terminal preview

## Tools Provided

- `ht_create_session`: Create new terminal sessions
- `ht_send_keys`: Send keystrokes to sessions
- `ht_take_snapshot`: Capture terminal state
- `ht_execute_command`: Execute commands and get output
- `ht_list_sessions`: List active sessions
- `ht_close_session`: Close sessions

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This project is currently under development. The basic project structure has been set up, but the following components are still being implemented:

- [ ] HT library fork and integration
- [ ] MCP protocol handlers
- [ ] Session management with real HT library
- [ ] Transport layer implementation
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
